# Learning Memfetch — Android Process Memory Acquisition Lab

### Objective
Perform **live process memory acquisition** on a **rooted Android 15 (OnePlus 13R)** device using **Memfetch**, targeting a **medical IoT mobile app (EMAY Pulse Oximeter)**.  
This lab demonstrates how sensitive health data remains in memory (heap, stack, static) even after app use — showing the forensic visibility of data remanence in Android devices.

---

##  Tools & Environment

| Tool / Device | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| **OnePlus 13R (Android 15, Kernel 6.1.x)** | Test device (rooted) |
| **Memfetch (ARM64 build)** | Process memory acquisition utility |
| **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** | File transfer & shell access |
| **EMAY Pulse Oximeter App** | Target process: `com.jack.emaybloodoxygen` |
| **Linux Host PC** | Analysis & storage of dumps |

---

## ⚙️ Step 1 — Setup & Deployment

1. Push memfetch binary to device:
   ```bash
   adb push memfetch_oneplus /data/local/tmp/memfetch_oneplus
````

2. Switch to root shell:

   ```bash
   adb shell
   su
   ```

3. Create working directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /data/local/tmp/emay_plaintext_dk
   cd /data/local/tmp/emay_plaintext_dk
   ```

---

## Step 2 — Identify Target Process

Locate the **EMAY Pulse Oximeter** process:

```bash
ps -A | grep emay
```

Example output:

```
24441   1633  8873448  248780  ... com.jack.emaybloodoxygen
```

---

##  Step 3 — Execute Memfetch

Attach Memfetch to the process and start dumping:

```bash
../memfetch_oneplus 24441
```

Memfetch uses ptrace-like read operations to capture live pages from the app process.

---

## Step 4 — Acquisition Progress

Memory regions (stack, heap, .data) are dumped into files such as `mem-000.bin`, `map-000.bin`, and an index file `mfetch.lst`.

![Memory Dump Progress](screenshots/4.png)
*Fig-4.1 — Dump in progress; over 3,500 regions successfully captured.*

---

##  Step 5 — Verify Dump Directory

List all created dump files:

```bash
ls -la /data/local/tmp/emay_plaintext_dk
```

Expect:

* Hundreds of `mem-###.bin` and `map-###.bin`
* Index file `mfetch.lst`

---

## 🧾 Step 6 — Validate Dump Completion

Navigate to `/data/local/tmp` and confirm your directories:

```bash
ls -la /data/local/tmp
```

Contains multiple acquisition sessions:

* `beurer_login_devika/`
* `emay_plaintext_dk/`
* `emay_sha512_dk/`

---

##  Step 7 — Pull Dump for Analysis

Transfer dumps to host machine:

```bash
adb pull /data/local/tmp/emay_plaintext_dk ./emay_plaintext_dk
```

Then extract readable strings:

```bash
strings mem-*.bin | grep -a "SpO2"
strings mem-*.bin | grep -a "PR"
```

Expected: health telemetry fragments like **SpO₂**, **PR(bpm)**, and timestamp data.

## Step 8 — Artifacts & Outputs

| Artifact             | Description                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `mem-*.bin`          | Raw memory dumps                   |
| `map-*.bin`          | Virtual memory maps                |
| `mfetch.lst`         | Memory region index                |
| `emay_plaintext_dk/` | Full plaintext capture directory   |
| `emay_sha512_dk/`    | Secondary encrypted or hashed dump |

**Completion message:**

```
Done (3569 matching). Have a nice day.
```

 **Successful acquisition confirmed.**

## Security & Privacy Implications

This experiment shows that **health data** from IoT medical apps may persist in RAM and can be recovered even after user interaction ends.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Zeroize memory** after use with `memset_s()` or `explicit_bzero()`.
2. **Encrypt in-RAM structures** for transient health data.
3. **Use mlock()** to prevent swapping sensitive pages.
4. **Adopt hardware key storage** for cryptographic operations.
5. **Perform regular forensic reviews** to verify no unprotected data remains in memory.
